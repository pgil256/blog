So today marks my first day of blogging about my journey as a developer.

A lot has happened lately, and there are some topics I'd like to cover:

**Good:** 3 application deployments, portfolio demo setup.

**Neutral:** Brushing up on my Python skills, PostgreSQL chops being tested.

**Ugly:** Knex, Docker, Middleware. Trying to keep the faith.

I have one more app to finish, then my static/github portfolio should be good to go. Much easier than hosting databases publicly. Wish me luck.
