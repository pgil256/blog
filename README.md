So today marks my first day of blogging my journey as a developer. 

A lot has happened latelyl here's some topics I'd like to cover:

Good: 3 application deployments, portfolio demo setup
Neutral: Brushing of my Python skills, Postgresql chops being tested
Ugly: Knex, Docker, Middleware. Trying to keep the faith.

I have one more app to finish then my static/github portfolio should be good to go. Much easier than hosting databases publicly. Wish me luck.
